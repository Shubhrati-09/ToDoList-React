# 📝 React ToDo List App
A modern and visually appealing **ToDo List** application built using **React + Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project helped me solidify my understanding of React concepts, especially **Context API**, and explore reusable, global state management techniques.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **React & Component-Based Architecture**  
  Built reusable components to manage tasks more cleanly.

- **Context API**  
  Instead of prop drilling, I used **React's Context API** to manage and share state (like the task list and functions to add, edit, delete, or toggle tasks) globally across components.  
  > The Context API allows you to create a global data layer and access or update shared state from **any component** without passing props manually at every level.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Used for rapid UI development with utility-first styling.

- **HeroPattern**  
  Used background SVG patterns from [HeroPatterns](https://heropatterns.com/) to make the app look elegant.

- **Local Storage**  
  Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage — so they persist even after reloading the page.



## ✨ Features
- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Edit existing tasks
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed
- ✅ Persist data with local storage


## 🔁 Difference from my Previous Project
### [🔗 ToDoTaskManager (Plain JS version)](https://github.com/Shubhrati-09/ToDoTaskManager)

| Feature | Old Version (JS) | New Version (React) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Tech Stack | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | React(with Vite), Tailwind CSS |
| State Management | DOM & manual state updates | Context API for global state |
| UI Design | Custom CSS | Tailwind + HeroPattern |
| Data Storage | Local Storage | Local Storage |
| Scalability | Limited | Component-based, more scalable |
| Code Reusability | Low | High (with components) |

## 💭 Personal Note
While this React + Vite version of the To-Do List showcases modern tools like Context API, Tailwind CSS, and localStorage integration, I still hold a special love for my original JavaScript version.

That project was entirely handcrafted—from the UI design to the logic. It was born purely from my ideas, and building it from scratch taught me a lot about structuring code and styling without libraries.

🎨 It may not be as powerful as this one, but it’s my favorite because it reflects my creativity and raw learning journey.
