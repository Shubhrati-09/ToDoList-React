# 📝 React ToDo List App
A modern and visually appealing **ToDo List** application built using **React + Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project helped me solidify my understanding of React concepts, especially **Context API**, and explore reusable, global state management techniques.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **React & Component-Based Architecture**  
  Built reusable components to manage tasks more cleanly.

- **Context API**  
  Instead of prop drilling, I used **React's Context API** to manage and share state (like the task list and functions to add, edit, delete, or toggle tasks) globally across components.  
  > The Context API allows you to create a global data layer and access or update shared state from **any component** without passing props manually at every level.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Used for rapid UI development with utility-first styling.

- **HeroPattern**  
  Used background SVG patterns from [HeroPatterns](https://heropatterns.com/) to make the app look elegant.

- **Local Storage**  
  Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage — so they persist even after reloading the page.
